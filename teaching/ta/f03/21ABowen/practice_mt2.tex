\paragraph{Problem 1}
Compute the derivative of $f(x)=\frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos ^2 x}$.
\vspace{1.5in}

\paragraph{Problem 2}
Compute the derivative of $f(x)=\sin x + \cos (x^2) + \tan (x^3)$.
\vspace{1.5in}

\paragraph{Problem 3}
Consider the function $f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + 2$.  \\

(a) Show that the function satisfies the hypothesis of Rolle's Theorem on the interval $[-2,2]$.
\vspace{1in}

(b) Find all numbers $c$ in $[-2,2]$ such that $f'(c)=0$.
\vspace{1in}

\paragraph{Problem 4}
Graph the following functions, and show all x-intercepts, y-intercepts, critical points, and asymptotes. \\

(a) $f(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 6x$
\vspace{2in}

(b) $f(x) = \frac{1}{2x^2 - x}$
\vspace{2in}

\paragraph{Problem 5}
A car begins to break at 20 feet from a traffic light.  Its velocity is initially $10 ft/s$ and it comes to a full stop right at the traffic light.  Assuming constant deceleration, how long does it take to stop?

\vspace{2in}

\paragraph{Problem 6}

For the following functions, find the inflection points and describe the intervals where the function is concave up or concave down.\\

(a) $f(x) = 3x^5 - 5x^4$
\vspace{1.5in}

(b) $f(x) = \sin x$
\vspace{1.5in}

\paragraph{Problem 7}
Consider positive numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $2x+y = 5$.  What is the maximum possible value of $xy$?
\vspace{1.5in}

\paragraph{Problem 8}
Let $y$ be a function such that $x^3+xy^2+\sin{y^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}+4+\pi}{4}$.  Find the tanget line to the graph at the point $(1, \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2})$.
\vspace{2in}

\paragraph{Problem 9}
The radius of a sphere is measured with a $10\%$ error.  Find the maximum absolute error on\\

(a) the surface area of the sphere (Hint: Surface area $= 4 \pi r^2$.)
\vspace{1.5in}

(b) the volume of the sphere
(Hint: Volume $= \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.)
\vspace{1.5in}

\paragraph{Problem 10}
The length of a leg of a right triangle is increasing at the rate of $5 ft/s$, and the length of the other leg is decreasing at the rate of $6 ft/s$.  What is the rate of change of the hypotenuse when the first leg is 3 feet long and the other leg is 4 feet long?  Is the hypotenuse getting longer or shorter at that moment?
