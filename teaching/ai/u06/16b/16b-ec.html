<h3>Extra Credit (5%)</h3>
<h3>Due Friday, September 15 by 5PM</h3>
Explain in a few paragraphs the ideas in Appendix A (clearly state all the
assumptions and conclusions in your own words, i.e. use your own 
interpretation/opinions).  To receive full credit the summary must be 
typewritten, informative, and at least 2 pages.  Your audience will be your 
friends who have some knowledge of functions, graphs and area.  Your goal is
to convince them of your explanation of Appendix A and hopefully they will
gain from it and be satisfied that they learned about the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus.
