        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
        Every week several homework problems are assigned.  You are
        supposed to solve them all, because the exams (midterms and the
        final) are based largely on the homework assignments.  There will
        be problems marked as <i>Submission Problems</i>.  They are due
        in class on either Tuesday or Thursday.
        <ul>
            <li>Print clearly (1) your full name; (2) the course number
            (Math 16B); and (3) the due date; at the top right corner of the
            front page of your homework paper.</li>
            <li>Please staple your homework if you use more than one sheet
            of paper.</li>
            <li>Submit your answer to the homework problems marked
            submission problems.</li>
            <li>The graded homework papers will be returned in the Homework
            Boxes at the basement of Wellman or in class.</li>
        </ul>
