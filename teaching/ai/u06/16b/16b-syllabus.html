        <h3><u>Grading</u></h3>
        Your grade will be determined by counting the scores of your
        homework, midterm examinations, and final examination with the
        following weight factors:<br><br>
        <table border=1>
            <tr>
                <td>Homework</td>
                <td>Lowest Midterm Score</td>
                <td>Highest Midterm Score</td>
                <td>Final</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>10%</td>
                <td>25%</td>
                <td>30%</td>
                <td>35%</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>

        <li><a href="16b-hw.html">Homework</a></li>

        <br>
        Homework will be assigned on either Tuesday or Thursday (except for the
        first homework).  Homework assigned on Tuesday will be due in class the
        following Thursday and homework assigned on Thursday will be due in 
        class the following Tuesday.  There will be approximately 11 homework
        assignments throughout this summer session.  For each homework
        assignment there will be roughly 20 problems.  The reader will grade a
        subset of these problems.  For convenience <i>all homework</i> will be
        posted on the course website, so please check regularly.<br><br>
        
        The <i>first homework</i> will be assigned on the first day of
        class and will be <i>due in class on Thursday (August 10, 2006)</i>.  
        <br><br>

        <i>Note:</i> Homework is assigned to give you practice
        with the material covered in the lectures.  The homework
        problems you submit to me are the minimum necessary to
        understand the material in the course.  For this, I am assigning
        suggested homework problems, you should solve them all, because
        the exams (midterms and the final) will be based largely on the
        homework assignments.
        <br><br>
           
        <li><a href="16b-exam.html">Examinations</a></li><br>
        There will be 2 midterm examinations and a final.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First Midterm: Friday, August 18.</li>
            <li>Second Midterm: Friday, September 1.</li>
            <li>Final Examination: Friday, September 15.</li>
        </ul>
        No electronic devices such as computers, calculators, cell
        phones etc., are allowed in these examinations.  Exam problems
        will be based on the homework problems and examples worked out in
        lectures.
        <br><br>
        No make up examination will be given.  If you missed a midterm
        exam due to the circumstances beyond your control, you should
        contact the instructor as soon as possible for a conference.
        <br><br>
        The final examination is comprehensive and thus covers the whole
        material of the course.  No one can be excused from the final
        examination.  In case you missed it, you should notify the
        Department immediately.  Upon receiving approval from the
        Department, the course grade <i>I</i> (incomplete) may be
        assigned to eligible students.  Please consult catalogue for
        guidelines of the incomplete grade.
