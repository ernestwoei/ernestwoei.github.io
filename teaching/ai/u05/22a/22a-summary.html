        <hr>
        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
        Every week we will go through several sections of the linear
        algebra book.  I would like you to write a brief summary of each
        section assigned.  Please do not copy directly from the book, but
        rather write it in your own words describing things such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Definitions</li>
            <li>Theorems</li>
            <li>Examples, etc</li>
        </ul>
        The summary will be due in class every Friday.  I will <b>update</b>
        this page with the sections assigned after each lecture.  So, 
        <b>please visit daily</b>.
        <ul>
            <li>Print clearly (1) your full name; (2) the course number
            (Math 22A); and (3) the due date; at the top right corner of the
            front page of your summary paper.</li>
            <li>Print clearly (1) Reading Summary at the top center of the
            front page and (2) the section numbers to be summarized.</li>
            <li>Please stape your summary if you use more than one sheet of
            paper.</li>
            <li>The summary will be returned in class or in the Homework
            Boxes at the basement of Wellman.</li>
        </ul>
