        <h3><u>Grading</u></h3>
        Your grade will be determined by counting the scores of your
        homework, summary reports, participation, midterm examinations, and 
        final examination with the following weight factors:<br><br>
        <table border=1>
            <tr>
                <td>Homework</td>
                <td>Reading Summary</td>
                <td>Participation</td>
                <td>First Midterm</td>
                <td>Second Midterm</td>
                <td>Final</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12%</td>
                <td>12%</td>
                <td>6%</td>
                <td>20%</td>
                <td>20%</td>
                <td>30%</td>
            </tr>
        </table><br>

        <li><a href="22a-hw.html">Homework</a></li>

        <br>
        The <b>first homework</b> will be assigned on the first day of
        class and will be <b>due in class on Wednesday (June 29, 2005)
        </b>.  The next homework and all subsequent homeworks will be
        assigned on Wednesday and due a week later in class.  There will
        be a total of 6 homeworks for the whole course with each
        homework counting for 2% of your grade.  For convenience, I will
        post the homework on the course webpage in the homework section.
        <br><br>
        <i>Note:</i> Homework is assigned to give you practice
        with the material covered in the lectures.  The homework
        problems you submit to me are the minimum necessary to
        understand the material in the course.  For this, I am assigning
        suggested homework problems, you should solve them all, because
        the exams (midterms and the final) will be based largely on the
        homework assignments.
        <br><br>
           
        <li><a href="22a-summary.html">Reading Summary</a></li><br>
        Each week I will cover several sections from the linear algebra
        book.  I want you to read and write a summary of those sections 
        (which I will announce in class and post on the webpage).  
        The reading summaries will then be turned in on Friday of that
        week.  There will be a total of 6 reading summaries for the
        whole course with each reading summary counting for 2% of your
        grade.  Please work on the summaries daily (especially during
        exam weeks).
        <br><br>
        These summaries are meant to aid you in your study of linear
        algebra, so you should write them well.  Here are list of
        things you may want to cover in these summaries (note: there are
        no restrictions on what you write about linear algebra in these 
        summaries):<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Definitions</li>
            <li>Theorems</li>
            <li>Solving the examples (in your own way)</li>
        </ul>
        Finally, there should be no stress in writing these, :-).
        <br><br>

        <li><a href="22a-exam.html">Examinations</a></li><br>
        There will be 2 midterm examinations and a final.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>First Midterm: Friday, July 8.</li>
            <li>Second Midterm: Friday, July 22.</li>
            <li>Final Examination: Friday, August 5.</li>
        </ul>
        No electronic devices such as computers, calculators, cell
        phones etc., are allowed in these examinations.  Exam problems
        will be based on the homework and reading assignments, and
        problems and examples worked out in lectures.
        <br><br>
        No make up examination will be given.  If you missed a midterm
        exam due to the circumstances beyond your control, you should
        contact the instructor as soon as possible for a conference.
        <br><br>
        The final examination is comprehensive and thus covers the whole
        material of the course.  No one can be excused from the final
        examination.  In case you missed it, you should notify the
        Department immediately.  Upon receiving approval from the
        Department, the course grade <i>I</i> (incomplete) may be
        assigned to eligible students.  Please consult catalogue for
        guidelines of the incomplete grade.

        <h3><u>Academic Conduct</u></h3>
        You are expected to strictly adhere to the 
        <a href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.htm">UCD Code of Academic Conduct</a>.
        <h3><u>Math 22AL</u></h3>
        The course MAT 22AL is a one unit, Pass/No Pass, online laboratory
        course.  It introduces to you the software package called MATLAB,
        and teaches you how to solve linear algebra problems with it.
        <br><br>
        You must take MAT 22AL concurrently with MAT 22A if you have not
        taken ENG 006 before.  Please note that ENG 006 does not substitute
        MAT 22AL.  Even you have taken ENG 006, it is strongly advised that
        you enroll in MAT 22AL this summer.
        <br><br>
        For more information on MAT 22AL, please visit the course Web page
        <a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~daddel/Math22al_S02/m98home.html">MAT 22AL (by Dr. Dad-del)</a>.
