        <b><u>July 6, 2005: Midterm and other information</u></b><br>
        The first midterm is this Friday and it will cover sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, Elementary Matrices, and some basics of permutations and inversions.  I updated the homework page with the new homework.  You may find it useful to do those problems to prepare for the midterm.  Also the reading summary page has been updated as well.
